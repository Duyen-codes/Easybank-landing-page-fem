## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.

[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

**To do this challenge, you need a basic understanding of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.**

## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this landing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

## Where to find everything

Your task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. You will find both a mobile and a desktop version of the design.

The designs are in JPG static format. Using JPGs will mean that you'll need to use your best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`.

You will find all the required assets in the `/images` folder. The assets are already optimized.

There is also a `style-guide.md` file containing the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.

## Workflow for building this project

I have followed these steps:

1. Initialize my project as a public repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/).

2. Look through the designs to start planning out how I'll tackle the project. This step is crucial to help me think ahead for CSS classes to create reusable styles.
3. Before adding any styles, I structure the content with HTML. Writing my HTML first can help focus my attention on creating well-structured content.
4. Write out the base styles for your project, including general content styles, such as `font-family` and `font-size`.
5. Start adding styles to the top of the page and work down. Only move on to the next section once you're happy you've completed the area you're working on.

## Got feedback for me?

I love receiving feedback! We're always looking to improve my solutions and codes. So if you have anything you'd like to mention, please email hongduyen0705[at]gmail[dot]com.

**Have fun building!** ðŸš€
