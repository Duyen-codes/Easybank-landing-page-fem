## Workflow for building this project

I have followed these steps:

1. Initialize my project as a public repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/).

2. Look through the designs to start planning out how I'll tackle the project. This step is crucial to help me think ahead for CSS classes to create reusable styles.
3. Before adding any styles, I structure the content with HTML. Writing my HTML first can help focus my attention on creating well-structured content.
4. Write out the base styles for your project, including general content styles, such as `font-family` and `font-size`.
5. Start adding styles to the top of the page and work down. Only move on to the next section once you're happy you've completed the area you're working on.

## Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS positioning
